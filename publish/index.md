Contributions can be of many things. 
* Raise a new important problem
* Formulate an old problem with a useful new form which may be much more easier to analyze
* Solve an already defined problem with new and better method
* Did great work in boosting the development of a field of study
* To be add more...

**TODO**: talk to Quan / Qing about sequence visualization
