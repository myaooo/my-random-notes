# About Presentation

## Presentation for academic purpose

### PQE

1. Fluent transition between subsections. Remember to note the bigger picture from time to time.

2. For the literature review part, remember to discuss the pros and cons of existing work with an objective  view.

3. For presentation, don't fill it with your whole paper. Presenting 30% of the content clearly is better than pouring 100% of blurry concepts.

4. For PQE/survey, spend a bit more time on the challenges that are faced in your topic area.
